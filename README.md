# Name
Work Day Scheduler

# Description

This project is a work day scheduler 

 - The program opens up to the current day and displays time blocks each hour from 9am to 5pm.

 - Each time block is color coded to the current time.  If time block is earlier then current time, block will be grey.  If time block is equal to current time then block will be red.  Finally, time blocks beyond current time are green.

 - You may enter appointments into each time block and the program will save appointments to local storage.

 - When you enter the scheduler your saved appointments will be loaded into the day.
